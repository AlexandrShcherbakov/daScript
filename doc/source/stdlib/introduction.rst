Introduction

The daScript standard libraries consist in a set of modules implemented in C++.
While are not essential for the language, they provide a set of useful services that are
commonly used by a wide range of applications(file I/O, regular expressions, etc...),
plus they offer a foundation for developing additional libraries.

All libraries are implemented through the daScript API and c++ runtime library.
The modules are organized in the following way:

* fio : input and output
* math : basic mathematical routines
* random : LCG random mathematical routines
* string : string library
