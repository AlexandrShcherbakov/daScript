parser
	support external global variables (as opposet to regular global variables)
	support external structures (no fields, just sizes)
    support array initialization and object initializatoin (c-tors?)
    support auto in let
    support late binding of default arguments
    support auto in function default arguments
    support auto in function arguments

misc
	support variadic functions (with type info)
    simplify builtin initialization
    support multi-dimensional array foreach
    support multi-dimensional array new (or regular array new)
    support (unsafe ?)

optimization \ ast massage
    flatten nested blocks
    eliminate dead code (after break and after return)
    flatten conditions
    simplify initialization of local variables
    propagate local variable initialization on top of the function
	
tests
	does not compile - for every error. add huge error enumeration. add 'expect' keyword
	every type with evey operator
	every concept
