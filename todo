    support auto in function arguments
	support assigning of the structures and default values for the structures

misc
    basic type - test pointer casts
    support 'clone' for variables, redo name lookup upstream during cloning?
    simplify builtin initialization
    support multi-dimensional array foreach
    support multi-dimensional array new (or regular array new)
    assert2 - need node, so that if ( !a ) b and not a,b, if
    &&, || - need nodes
    support (unsafe ?)
    support extern functions stackwalk

optimization \ ast massage
    flatten nested blocks
    eliminate dead code (after break and after return)
    flatten conditions
    support break and return to be last statement
    simplify initialization of local variables
    propagate local variable initialization on top of the function
